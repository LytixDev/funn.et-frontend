<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

Some issues are marked with the `further-work` label. These are features we would have liked to include in the final project, but were not implemented due to time constraits. Some features may also require changes in the [backend](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/ntcc/fullstack-backend).

Some issues are marked with the `known-bug` label. These are bugs we have identified and are yet to fix.

See the [open issues](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/ntcc/fullstack-frontend/-/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- Testing -->

## Testing

We have had a lot of pain and issues with Vitest (issues include mounting, stores, and other pains that we did not seem to have with cypress), we have opted to rather use cypress tests, and testing components and integration with these tests instead.

<!-- Known Faults -->

## Known Faults

### E2E Running

Some Systems have issuse with running e2e test, a workaround for this is to run `yarn vite dev --port 4173` and in another terminal run `yarn cypress open --e2e`

### Runners in pipeline

The runners on the pipeline sometimes fails without a known reason. For this, i recommend re-running the tests.
